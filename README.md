🌿 Myco-Net: The AI Fungal Network Interpreter
Myco-Net is a groundbreaking AI solution for sustainable agriculture that shifts crop management from a reactive to a proactive process.
By decoding subtle signals from the wood wide web—the underground fungal communication network—our system provides real-time diagnostics and early stress warnings, enabling small-scale farmers to take action before damage becomes visible.

✨ Key Innovations
AI-Driven Signal Interpretation
Uses advanced machine learning to analyze biological & environmental data, detecting hidden stress patterns in plants.

Proactive Diagnostics
Goes beyond visible symptoms by predicting issues such as water stress, nutrient deficiencies, and soil-borne pathogens 🌾.

Two-Tiered Validation
✅ Foundational dataset – plant health data
✅ Specialized dataset – fungal communication metrics
