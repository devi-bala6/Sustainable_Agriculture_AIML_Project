# Myco-Net: The AI Fungal Network Interpreter

Myco-Net: The AI Fungal Network Interpreter
Myco-Net is a groundbreaking AI solution designed to shift sustainable agriculture from a reactive to a proactive process. By interpreting the subtle signals from the "wood wide web"â€”the natural communication network of fungi in the soilâ€”our system provides real-time diagnostics and early warnings of plant stress, empowering small-scale farmers to take action before crop damage becomes visible.

# Key Innovations
AI-Driven Signal Interpretation: A sophisticated machine learning model interprets complex biological and environmental data, identifying hidden patterns that indicate plant stress.

Proactive Diagnostics: Unlike traditional methods that react to visible symptoms, Myco-Net provides a precise, pre-emptive diagnosis of issues like water stress, nutrient deficiencies, or soil-borne pathogens. ðŸŒ¾

Two-Tiered Validation: Our project strategy is built on a two-phase analysis that validates our AI engine with both a foundational dataset and a specialized dataset containing crucial fungal metrics.

# Project Structure
This repository is organized to clearly document the project's development pipeline:

/Myco-Net/
|-- myco_net_analysis.ipynb   (The main Jupyter notebook with all code and analysis)
|-- plant_health_data.csv       (Dataset for the foundational analysis)
|-- Tree_Data.csv             (Dataset for the core Myco-Net analysis)
|-- README.md                   (This file)

#How to Run the Project
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Myco-Net.git

Open in Jupyter:
Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and open the myco_net_analysis.ipynb file.

Run the Notebook:
Run all the cells in the notebook from top to bottom. The notebook will automatically load the data, train the models, and generate all visualizations and reports.
