Myco-Net: The AI Fungal Network Interpreter ðŸŒ¿
Myco-Net is a groundbreaking AI solution designed to shift sustainable agriculture from a reactive to a proactive process. By interpreting the subtle signals from the "wood wide web"â€”the natural communication network of fungi in the soilâ€”our system provides real-time diagnostics and early warnings of plant stress, empowering small-scale farmers to take action before crop damage becomes visible.

Key Innovations
AI-Driven Signal Interpretation: A sophisticated machine learning model interprets complex biological and environmental data, identifying hidden patterns that indicate plant stress.

Proactive Diagnostics: Unlike traditional methods that react to visible symptoms, Myco-Net provides a precise, pre-emptive diagnosis of issues like water stress, nutrient deficiencies, or soil-borne pathogens ðŸŒ¾.

Two-Tiered Validation: Our project strategy is built on a two-phase analysis that validates our AI engine with both a foundational dataset and a specialized dataset containing crucial fungal metrics.

How to Run the Project
To get started with Myco-Net, follow these simple steps:

Clone the Repository: Use the following command to clone the project to your local machine:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/[Your_Username]/[Your_Repo_Name].git
Run the Analysis Notebook: To understand the model training and data preprocessing, open and run the Jupyter notebook.

Navigate to the src/ directory.

Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and open the myco_net_analysis.ipynb file.

Run all the cells from top to bottom.

Run the Web Application: To launch the interactive web app, use Streamlit.

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (streamlit, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn).

From the root of the project directory, run the following command in your terminal:

Bash

streamlit run src/app.py
This will open the application in your web browser, where you can interact with the models.
